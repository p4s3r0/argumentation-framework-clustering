\section{Setup}
The experiment was conducted on a personal computer environment. The exact specification can be seen in \cref{table:ExperimentSpecs}. Generally, we used an AMD CPU with 6 cores and 12 Threads running the \textit{x86\_64} architecture. We had a total RAM memory of 16GB, which sometimes was not enough and we had to add another 16GB of SWAP memory. Every testrun was conducted on the same setup, running Linux as primarily OS.

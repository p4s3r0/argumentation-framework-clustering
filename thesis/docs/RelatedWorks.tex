In recent years, publications targetting the topic of clustering arguments in AFs have been released. One of the first papers been written in this field was the paper ''Existential Abstraction on Argumentation Frameworks via Clustering`` from Saribatur and Wallner \cite{DBLP:conf/kr/SaribaturW21}. Since then, a tool was created (absarg-clustering)\cite{GitHub:repoRelatedTool} to determine faithfulness and spuriousness of an AF and automatically finding non-spurious partitions. Furthermore, every two years the International Competitions on Computational Models of Argumentation (ICCMA) \cite{COMP:ICCMA2023} runs a competition, aiming to assess the state of the art in practical systems for reasoning in central argumentation formalisms.
